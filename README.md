Exercism exercises in C#

## Contributing Guide

Please see the [contributing guide](https://github.com/exercism/docs/tree/master/contributing-to-language-tracks)

### Adding a new exercise
To add a new exercise you can run the `add-new-exercise.ps1` PowerShell script. This will create all the necessary files and tests for you. Then you just need to implement the `Example.cs` file and to check if the generated tests make sense. Parameters and examples for running the script can be found in the script file.
